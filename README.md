# Derivative-calculator
All calculators were created without using specific libraries. The main logic involves tokenizing the expression and, by enumerating the tokens, identifying the type of expression. Then, using basic formulas, the derivative is computed by modifying the tokenized expression.

The console program only calculates derivatives of basic functions without handling multiplication, exponentiation, and division. These functions, along with a graphical user interface (GUI), were added in the 'Derivative calculator graphic interface' version.
